## Description

This Home Assistant add-on is a fork and extension of the official **wmbusmeters-ha-addon**, based on **wmbusmeters**.

The purpose of this add-on is to decode Wireless M-Bus (C1 / T1 / S1) telegrams in Home Assistant **without a local radio dongle** (USB/RTL-SDR). Instead, it uses **external receivers** (ESP32/gateway/bridge) and **MQTT as the input transport**.

Since **1.5.49** the add-on can additionally **poll a wired M-Bus** through an M-Bus master converter on a serial port (USB / RS-232 / RS-485), as a third `wmbusmeters` instance next to DECODE and LISTEN. That path is **optional, off by default and not verified against a real bus** (the author has no such hardware — the protocol was tested against a simulator). Disabled, it does not start and does not touch the radio path, which remains the primary one and is what everything below describes. Details: [full documentation](docs/README.en.md).

This add-on consumes raw wMBus hex frames from MQTT and is typically paired with the companion firmware [`esphome-wmbus-bridge-rawonly`](https://github.com/Kustonium/esphome-wmbus-bridge-rawonly) running on an ESP32 with a **CC1101, SX1276 or SX1262** radio. The two projects work as a pipeline (ESP receives radio → MQTT raw hex → this add-on parses → HA), but each is **independent**: this add-on accepts hex from any source publishing to the configured `raw_topic`.

> 🌉 **As a whole: the ESP (RF receiver) + this add-on (decoder) form a distributed _wM-Bus → Home Assistant gateway_.** The radio sits where the signal is, while decoding (decryption and the driver set from the pinned `wmbusmeters` build) runs on HA. Unlike **monolithic wM-Bus gateways** (radio + decoder in one box), this architecture needs no local USB dongle and scales by adding cheap ESP nodes. Each half also works standalone: the ESP feeds any MQTT backend, and the add-on decodes hex from any source (rtl-wmbus, another gateway, the replay tool) — they cooperate, but neither depends on the other.

> 🧱 **Responsibility boundary:** the project ships two MQTT clients (ESP + add-on); its scope ends at the MQTT topic. The broker itself — authentication, ACLs, TLS, exposure and broker-to-broker bridging for distributed setups (A → internet → B) — is the operator's. Keep the broker on your LAN; for remote access use a tunnel/VPN or TLS broker bridging. ⚠️ Beginners: do **not** forward the broker port (1883) or HA to the internet on your router — for outside access use a ready-made option: **Nabu Casa**, **Tailscale** or **Cloudflare Tunnel**. Unsure? Keep everything on the LAN.

### The problem it solves

The original **wmbusmeters-ha-addon** assumes local radio reception and does not accept external telegram sources or STDIN input. ESP32-based receivers, gateways and custom wM-Bus bridges cannot be used directly as data sources with the official add-on.

### Solution

This fork introduces an MQTT-based input path:

```
Radio path (primary):
ESP32 / Gateway / Bridge
→ MQTT (raw wM-Bus HEX telegram)
→ wmbusmeters (stdin:hex)
→ MQTT (JSON)
→ Home Assistant (MQTT Discovery)

Wired path (optional, off by default):
Meter on an M-Bus bus
→ M-Bus master converter on a serial port
→ wmbusmeters (polling, separate instance)
→ MQTT (JSON)
→ Home Assistant (MQTT Discovery)
```

Both paths meet at the same place: the entity layer never asks where a decoded telegram came from, so units, `device_class`, the measurement/diagnostic split and calculated/constant fields all behave identically.

### Key features

- MQTT input for raw wM-Bus telegrams
- STDIN support for wmbusmeters (`stdin:hex`)
- Full decoding handled by upstream wmbusmeters
- MQTT output with Home Assistant Discovery
- Field selection: the meter modal (**Add meter** / **Driver…**) lists every field the driver can report, each with the description from `wmbusmeters` and a checkbox, next to a box for patterns (`consumption_at_history_*`). An unchecked field gets no entity — and if one already existed, it is removed together with its history.
- Field descriptions on the entity: each entity carries a `Description` attribute written by the driver author, alongside the decoded telegram fields.
- Status diagnostic entities: when a meter reports a `status` field, a text sensor with the value supplied by the selected `wmbusmeters` driver plus a `binary_sensor` (`device_class: problem`) that turns on for any non-`OK` state. **Every** driver field is published: those with a consumption unit or a recognised `device_class` as plain sensors, everything else (unclassified numbers, text, `null` fields) as diagnostic entities disabled by default, so you enable only the ones you need
- Wired M-Bus (optional, off by default): the add-on can poll a bus itself through a converter on a serial port — port selection without scanning (probing could talk into a Zigbee coordinator), a primary-address scan that classifies each reply, a read-only console and a status panel that names the cause of silence instead of leaving you with "nothing arrives". **Not verified against a real bus** — the protocol was tested against a simulator.
- Real reception counting and evidence export (optional, off by default): when the firmware publishes receive metadata on `wmbus/<board>/rx`, the add-on counts actual receptions per meter and per board instead of percentages each board computed about itself. `esp_rx_api_enabled` additionally exposes `GET /api/esp-rx` and a download button for the RX history — with no RAW telegrams, AES keys or credentials.
- Qundis walk-by block (optional, off by default): Qundis meters pack the whole reading into one manufacturer record (`0DFF5F`) and, since the 2026 generation, encrypt it inside that record — at the wM-Bus layer the frame looks unencrypted, so nothing signals that a key is needed. `qds_walkby_enabled` rejects records that cannot be validated (without it the decoder publishes ciphertext as a reading once in 256 telegrams, e.g. 15430.611 m³ on a meter reading 1.387) and, when the meter's ordinary AES key is configured — the same one its regular frames use — decrypts the block and hands the decoder readable content.
- LISTEN mode: when `meters` list is empty, logs all detected meter IDs and suggested drivers
- Value filtering: when LISTEN hears many neighbours' meters, the WebUI filters already displayed values by the physical meter reading and tolerance
- Interactive WebUI: browser management panel (HA side panel / port `8099` in Docker) — detected candidates, modal-based meter add, value preview without permanent configuration, value filtering, driver comparison and ESP logs. Available in 5 languages: 🇬🇧 EN · 🇵🇱 PL · 🇩🇪 DE · 🇨🇿 CS · 🇸🇰 SK.

### Broker modes (`mqtt_mode`)

- `auto` (default) — detection order: **1)** `external_mqtt_host` when set (wins even if the HA broker is also up); **2)** the HA broker from the Supervisor service (Mosquitto add-on); **3)** a probe of well-known broker add-ons (`core-mosquitto`, EMQX `a0d7b954-emqx`) — using `external_mqtt_username/password` when provided, anonymously otherwise. When the probe finds a broker that rejects the login, the log states exactly which fields are missing.
- `ha` — force HA broker (Mosquitto add-on)
- `external` — always use external settings (`external_mqtt_host`, etc.)

### ⚙️ Notice on AI, documentation and translations

This project is **AI-developed**. The human role (**Kustonium**) is testing, validation and architectural decisions (human-in-the-loop) — not writing code character by character.

All user-facing text files — READMEs, the documentation under `docs/`, the WebUI translations in [`rootfs/usr/bin/i18n.py`](rootfs/usr/bin/i18n.py), the CHANGELOG, log messages — are machine-generated. They may contain errors or unnatural phrasing in **any language, including Polish and English**, not only in German, Czech or Slovak.

---

### WebUI (management panel)

The add-on ships an interactive web panel (a side panel or the **OPEN WEB UI** button in Home Assistant, port `8099` in Docker). It is the primary way to use the add-on — discovering and adding meters needs no manual file editing.

Views:

- **Dashboard** — the radio pipeline and, after its first valid reply, the wired M-Bus pipeline, reception statistics and detected ESP boards.
- **Meters** — configured radio and wired meters with their current value and an explicit source (`ESP` or `M-Bus · <alias>`).
- **Received / Search** — LISTEN-mode candidates (ID, driver, media, encryption, reception). Candidates without a required AES key are decoded by one-shot preview processes, and their current value appears in the **Value** column without permanent configuration. Candidates requiring AES are skipped until a key is provided. The **Filter by value** bar narrows already displayed data without running extra drivers.
- **Logs** — a short runtime event stream (full logs are in the add-on **Log** tab).
- **ESP Logs** — diagnostics from ESP receivers (events, RSSI, boot, suggestions) and multi-board detection based on incoming `wmbus/+/telegram` telegrams.
- **Settings** — active runtime configuration and `options.json` snapshot; the global add-on restart button is in the WebUI top bar. Scalar options from the add-on schema can be **edited** here, while meters are managed in **Received / Search**; core options take effect after a restart.
- **M-Bus** — configuration, status, address scan and console for the optional wired bus.
- **About** — the actual radio/wired pipelines and the AI-assistance notice; the full notice is also in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md).

**Driver comparison:** in the **Add meter** or **Driver…** modal, choose a driver, enter the AES key if the meter is encrypted, then click **Compare**. The left column shows the saved driver or `wmbusmeters` auto-detection; the right column shows the driver selected in the **Driver** field. Green rows are fields available only with the selected driver, amber rows are different values; more fields do not prove the driver is correct — compare the values with the meter display.

The interface is available in 5 languages (🇬🇧 EN · 🇵🇱 PL · 🇩🇪 DE · 🇨🇿 CS · 🇸🇰 SK) — switcher in the top-right corner. Full description of the views: [docs EN §5](docs/README.en.md#5-the-webui--what-you-see).

### Configuration in Home Assistant (GUI)

Configuration is done through the add-on GUI — no manual file editing required. The easiest path: find the meter in the **Received / Search** view and click **Add meter**. The steps below also describe the log-based path.

#### Step 1 — LISTEN mode (meter discovery)

Leave the **meters** list empty and start the add-on. The log will show all received telegrams:

```
Received telegram from: 41553221
          manufacturer: (TCH) Techem
                  type: Cold water
                driver: mkradio3
=== NEW METER CANDIDATE DETECTED ===
Received telegram from: 41553221
Suggested driver: mkradio3
```

Note the **8-digit number** (`meter_id`) and the suggested **driver**.

#### Step 2 — Add a meter in the GUI

Fill in the **meters** section in the add-on configuration:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `id` | Your meter label used in Discovery names and generated configuration | `cold_water_bathroom` |
| `meter_id` | 8-digit number from LISTEN mode | `41553221` |
| `type` | Driver from LISTEN mode | `mkradio3` |
| `key` | Encryption key (if meter encrypts) | `00112233...` or leave empty |

If the meter does not encrypt telegrams, leave `key` empty.

#### Value filtering and the legacy SEARCH mode

The primary identification workflow is the **Filter by value** bar in
**Received / Search**. Enter the reading from the physical display and a
tolerance; the WebUI hides rows whose already displayed values are outside that
range. The filter performs no extra decoding, tries no additional drivers and
does not change configuration.

The legacy `search_mode` backend remains available in advanced configuration,
but its view is hidden from navigation. It works in two stages:

1. With an empty `meters` list, LISTEN stores only explicitly unencrypted water
   candidates and one suggested driver in `/data/search_candidates.tsv`.
2. On the following restart, the add-on creates temporary `search_<meter_id>`
   meters and compares numeric fields whose names contain `m3` or `total_volume`
   with the expected reading.
3. On a match it prints `SEARCH MATCH` and `SEARCH SUGGESTED CONFIG`.

Example output:

```text
[wmbus-bridge][WARN] SEARCH MATCH: id=03534159 driver=hydrodigit media=water field=total_m3 value=23.932 m3 expected=23.93 diff=0.002000 m3
[wmbus-bridge][WARN] SEARCH SUGGESTED CONFIG: {"id":"meter_03534159","meter_id":"03534159","type":"hydrodigit","type_other":"","key":""}
```

Recommended settings:

| Field | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| `search_mode` | `true` only while identifying a meter |
| `search_expected_value_m3` | current physical meter reading, for example `23.93` or `23,93` |
| `search_tolerance_m3` | usually `0.05` (50 liters); avoid wide values such as `0.5` in apartment blocks |
| `search_topic` | optional MQTT topic for search results, default: `wmbus/search/candidates` |

Important rules:

- SEARCH is only for meter identification — disable `search_mode` after finding the ID.
- Temporary `search_*` meters are excluded from Home Assistant Discovery.
- Copy `SEARCH SUGGESTED CONFIG` into the `meters` section after finding the match.
- Remove `/data/search_candidates.tsv` after searching if you want the next search to start from a clean candidate list.
- Use a narrow tolerance for water meters in apartment blocks, for example `0.05`, because many nearby meters may have similar readings.

### Current / period consumption from `total_m3`

If the decoder JSON exposes **only `total_m3`** and no instantaneous-flow field,
the bridge does not synthesize one. Derive current or period consumption from
`total_m3` natively in Home Assistant:

- **Utility Meter** (Settings → Devices & services → Helpers → *Utility meter*): point it at the entity created for the `total_m3` field and pick a cycle (daily/monthly) → HA computes period consumption. Its state **survives add-on restarts and updates**.
- **Derivative** helper: instantaneous flow (e.g. m³/h) from the `total_m3` increase — resolution limited by the meter's telegram interval.

`total_m3` is published with `device_class: water` and `state_class: total_increasing`, so it also feeds HA water / Energy statistics.

---

### Docker standalone (without Home Assistant)

In Docker mode, configuration is done via `options.json`.

#### Quick start (Docker Compose — DietPi/Ubuntu)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kustonium/homeassistant-wmbus-mqtt-bridge.git
mkdir -p /home/wmbus-test
cp -a homeassistant-wmbus-mqtt-bridge/docker/examples/* /home/wmbus-test/
cd /home/wmbus-test
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f wmbus
```

The `wmbus` image is multi-arch (amd64 + aarch64) — `pull` fetches the variant
matching your host automatically, no local build toolchain needed.

If you see `No meters configured -> LISTEN MODE` — the container is running and waiting for telegrams.

#### Configuration (Docker)

Main file: `./config/options.json` (inside container: `/config/options.json`).

Files under `./config/etc/` are **auto-generated on startup** — do not edit them manually.

**Meter fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Your label used in Discovery names and generated configuration |
| `meter_id` | 8-digit serial number (from LISTEN mode) |
| `type` | wmbusmeters driver (from LISTEN mode), or `auto` |
| `type_other` | Custom driver name — only when `type` is `other` |
| `key` | Encryption key in HEX; leave empty if the meter is not encrypted |
| `exclude_fields` | Patterns for fields that should get NO entity in HA, separated by commas or spaces (e.g. `consumption_at_history_*, history_*_date`). Empty publishes everything |

> ℹ️ The full option list (e.g. `discovery_prefix`, `discovery_retain`, `state_retain`, `debug_every_n`, `search_delta_mode`, `search_min_delta_m3`) is in `config.yaml` and the full documentation: [docs/README.en.md](docs/README.en.md).

Example `options.json`:

```json
{
  "raw_topic": "wmbus/+/telegram",
  "loglevel": "normal",
  "filter_hex_only": true,
  "discovery_enabled": true,
  "state_prefix": "wmbusmeters",
  "search_mode": false,
  "search_expected_value_m3": 0,
  "search_tolerance_m3": 0.05,
  "mqtt_mode": "external",
  "external_mqtt_host": "192.168.1.10",
  "external_mqtt_port": 1883,
  "external_mqtt_username": "user",
  "external_mqtt_password": "pass",
  "meters": [
    {
      "id": "cold_water_bathroom",
      "meter_id": "41553221",
      "type": "mkradio3",
      "key": ""
    },
    {
      "id": "heat_apartment",
      "meter_id": "03534275",
      "type": "hydrodigit",
      "key": "00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF"
    }
  ]
}
```

Restart after changes:

```bash
docker compose restart wmbus
```

#### Notes

- `./config` must be **writable** (do not mount as `:ro`) — the bridge creates `options.json` and wmbusmeters config there.
- The default `raw_topic` is `wmbus/+/telegram` in both modes (HA `config.yaml` and the first `/config/options.json` generated by `docker/entrypoint.sh`) — matching firmware that publishes to `wmbus/<device>/telegram`. An `options.json` generated by an older version may carry `wmbus_bridge/+/telegram` — fix it manually and restart the container.
- The WebUI **Restart** button works in Docker too: the container receives SIGTERM and exits, and the **restart policy** brings it back (the example compose has `restart: unless-stopped`). If you run the container without a restart policy, the button acts as a "stop" — start it again manually (`docker start <container>`).

#### Manual MQTT test

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'wmbus/any/telegram' -m '<HEX_TELEGRAM>'
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'wmbusmeters/#' -v
```
