## 1.5.26-dev

### Fixed
- Configured meters added on an existing installation kept showing a bare
  3-letter manufacturer code (e.g. `NES`) instead of the full display name
  (`NES · NORA ELK MALZ SAN ve TIC`); a clean install showed the full name,
  an upgrade did not, and the value only healed after removing the meters from
  the list. Root cause: the full manufacturer text comes only from
  `wmbusmeters`' listen-mode analysis block, which is printed only when an
  instance has zero meters. With meters configured, the primary pipeline runs
  in DECODE mode (JSON, no manufacturer name) and the parallel LISTEN instance
  is loaded with candidate `meter-preview-<id>` files, so neither instance is
  in "print all telegrams" mode for the configured meters (which are pruned
  from the preview dir, and AES meters never get a preview). The configured
  meter therefore had no source for its full manufacturer text and the WebGUI
  fell back to the bare RAW M-field code.

### Added
- New dedicated manufacturer-detection LISTEN instance
  (`rootfs/usr/bin/bridge-lib/14-detect.sh`) that always runs `wmbusmeters`
  against a config dir with zero meter files, so it stays permanently in
  "Printing id:s of all telegrams heard!" mode and emits the manufacturer
  analysis block for every telegram, including configured meters. Its parser
  updates only the manufacturer column of an existing candidate row via
  `candidate_update_manufacturer_text()`; it does not touch reception stats,
  preview values, candidate analysis or events, so it cannot double-count
  anything the primary or parallel pipelines already track. The instance is
  started idempotently next to the parallel LISTEN and stopped via the
  shutdown trap. `bridge.sh` and the new module only; no changes to the DECODE
  pipeline, preview decoding, TSV schema, MQTT topics or the WebGUI.

## 1.5.25-dev

### Fixed
- Configured-meters-on-air panel showed a bare 3-letter manufacturer code
  (e.g. `NES`) instead of the compact display name
  (`NES · NORA ELK MALZ SAN ve TIC`) after upgrading from a pre-1.5.22
  installation, and the code never healed even after hundreds of telegram
  receptions. Two causes were addressed in `bridge-lib`:
  - `candidate_fill_manufacturer_code()` (RAW hex path, `05-raw.sh`) only
    filled column 9 of `status_candidates.tsv` when it was empty. A legacy
    bare 3-letter code left by an old installation is non-empty, so the
    write was skipped on every restart. It now also matches `/^[A-Z]{3}$/`
    so a legacy code is treated like an empty cell. Full-text names do not
    match the pattern and are never downgraded.
  - `_process_listen_text_block()` (parallel LISTEN, `11-listen.sh`) only
    wrote the manufacturer after an early `[[ -n id && -n driver ]]` guard.
    `wmbusmeters` omits the `driver:` line for telegrams it cannot decrypt
    or recognise, so the full manufacturer text captured by the LISTEN text
    path never reached the TSV. A new `candidate_update_manufacturer_text()`
    in `06-candidates.sh` now writes the full text form before the driver
    guard, overwriting only an empty or bare 3-letter column. It never
    creates rows and never touches reception stats or events.

## 1.5.24-dev

### Changed
- Maintenance refactor: split helper functions from the large
  `rootfs/usr/bin/bridge.sh` runtime script into sourced modules under
  `rootfs/usr/bin/bridge-lib/`. The refactor keeps `bridge.sh` as the
  Home Assistant/Docker entrypoint and leaves startup initialization,
  wrapper integration and `run_once` orchestration in `bridge.sh`.
- The extracted modules now group existing bridge logic by responsibility:
  logging/utilities, options parsing, atomic TSV helpers, status files, raw
  telegram helpers, candidate lifecycle, meter file generation and value
  selection, Home Assistant Discovery helpers/publishing, SEARCH, Parallel
  LISTEN, MQTT pipeline helpers and ESP subscribers.
- This development cycle is intended to be behaviour-preserving. WebUI status
  file formats, MQTT topics, Home Assistant Discovery identifiers, reload
  markers and generated `wmbusmeters` configuration are not intentionally
  changed by the modularization.

### Fixed
- Hardened bridge module loading so `bridge.sh` resolves `bridge-lib` from
  `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` instead of `$0`, preserving execution through wrappers,
  direct script calls and PATH-based smoke tests.
- Updated the IZAR fixture test lookup so it validates the extracted meter
  helper in `bridge-lib/07-meters.sh` after the refactor.

## 1.5.22-dev

### Fixed
- Candidate `manufacturer` (column 9 of `status_candidates.tsv`) no longer
  stays empty when official meters are configured. Once a candidate has a
  `meter-preview-<id>` file, the parallel LISTEN instance decodes its
  telegrams to JSON — which carries no manufacturer name — and
  `status_candidate_seen_from_json()` updated the row without it, so
  persisted candidates (and the configured-meters panel that borrows the
  candidate's manufacturer) showed a blank `Producent`. Every raw telegram
  carries the wMBus M-field, so `status_raw_candidate_seen()` now decodes
  the 3-letter EN 13757 manufacturer code via the new
  `mfct_code_from_raw_hex()` and fills it into an existing candidate row
  through `candidate_fill_manufacturer_code()` only when the column is
  empty. The full text name from the LISTEN text path stays authoritative
  (a later text update still overwrites the bare code via
  `_upsert_candidate_row`), no candidate rows are created, and reception
  stats / events are untouched (no double counting). `bridge.sh` only.

## 1.5.21-dev

### Fixed
- Correct `total_m3` selection for IZAR meters: the bridge now prefers
  the current `total_m3` field over `last_month_total_m3` when both are
  present in the decoded JSON. Previously, the historical monthly value
  was selected over the live reading in some field-ordering situations.

- Preserve preview context after a candidate is added to the
  configuration: the cached preview value and state
  (`status_candidate_preview_state.tsv`) are now kept visible in the
  pending-meters panel until the first official DECODE telegram arrives,
  instead of being cleared immediately on pipeline reload.

- Self-heal orphaned `meter-preview-*` files: when a candidate is
  officially configured, the bridge now removes its
  `meter-preview-<id>` file and the `.preview_attempts/<id>` counter
  on every restart-loop iteration. A guard in
  `ensure_candidate_autodecode()` also prevents the file from being
  re-created for officially configured meters on subsequent telegrams.
  `status_candidate_values.tsv` and `status_candidate_preview_state.tsv`
  are deliberately preserved.

### Added
- Manual "Usuń podgląd" / Cancel preview button in the new SPA WebGUI:
  available in the candidates table, the pending-meters section, and the
  configured-meters-on-air panel whenever `preview_active` is true.
  Calls the existing `/api/cancel-preview` endpoint.

- Regression tests for IZAR current total selection, covering real
  user-reported HEX telegrams where `total_m3` and
  `last_month_total_m3` co-exist in the decoded output.

## 1.5.19-dev

### Fixed
- FU-008: Diehl/SAP (mfct 0x304C) RAW fallback no longer hardcodes
  `izarv2 / Water meter (0x07)` for every SAP telegram. The A/TYPE byte
  (raw[18:20]) is now read: type `0x07` keeps the unchanged izarv2 water
  path, any other type registers as `auto` + a mapped label via the new
  `map_device_type()` (known OMS types + `Unknown meter type (0xXX)`
  fallback, no full 0x00–0xFF table). Added a hard LISTEN-over-RAW
  priority: if the candidate already has a concrete (non-`auto`) driver
  from a real LISTEN classification, the RAW fallback returns without
  overwriting it — fixing the alternating overwrite race (e.g. non-water
  Diehl flapping auto → sharky → auto). bridge.sh only; IZAR water path
  and lowercase-ID handling unchanged.

## 1.5.18-dev

PRD §14 follow-up batch (FU-001, FU-002, FU-005). Verification-only
items FU-003 and FU-004 needed no code change (current behaviour already
correct; reference PRD updated).

### Fixed
- FU-001: unified the `search_tolerance_m3` default to `0.05` across all
  runtime and Docker fallbacks. `bridge.sh` used a stale `1` fallback in
  two spots (`json_get '.search_tolerance_m3' '1'` and
  `float_or_default "${SEARCH_TOLERANCE_M3}" "1"`) and
  `docker/entrypoint.sh` seeded the default `options.json` with `1`.
  Without an explicit value, Docker users (and anyone clearing the option)
  got a 20× wider match tolerance than the documented `0.05`, risking
  false matches in multi-dwelling buildings. `config.yaml` was already
  correct.

- FU-005: the "Restart add-on" button no longer silently fakes success in
  Docker standalone mode. Without a Supervisor API, `/api/restart-bridge`
  can only return a 400, yet the frontend swallowed the error, entered the
  "restarting" overlay and — because the WebUI process never actually went
  down — reported "Add-on restarted successfully". The handler now detects
  `meta.runtime === "docker"` and shows a clear instruction to run
  `docker restart <container>` on the host instead. New i18n key
  `restart_docker_manual` (EN/PL/DE/CS/SK). HA behaviour unchanged.

### Docs
- FU-002: corrected the published MQTT state/Discovery topic examples in
  all READMEs (EN/PL/DE/SK/CS). The topic uses the hardware serial
  (`.id`, e.g. `wmbusmeters/41553221/state`), not the user label — docs
  previously showed `wmbusmeters/cold_water_bathroom/state`. Discovery
  topic and `unique_id` now use `wmbus_<meter_id>`; the user label is kept
  only in the sensor `name`. Placeholders fixed: `<id>` → `<meter_id>`,
  `sensor/<id>_<field>` → `sensor/wmbus_<meter_id>/<field>`.

## 1.5.3-dev

Development snapshot ahead of the next stable cut. Bundles the
stable-track fixes already promoted to 1.5.1 / 1.5.2 plus a batch of
WebUI polish and an exhaustive unit-suffix table.

### Added
- `unit_from_key()` (WebUI) and full rewrite of `guess_unit()`
  (`bridge.sh`) with the exhaustive wmbusmeters field-suffix
  vocabulary. Longest suffixes are checked first so `_kwh`
  isn't shadowed by `_kw`, `_kvarh` by `_kvar`, `_m3h` by `_m3`,
  etc. New coverage includes `kVARh`/`kVAh`/`kVAR`/`kVA`, `J/h`,
  `GJ`/`MJ`, `dBm`, `hca`, `pct`/`ppm`, `bar`, `Pa`, `mol`, `min`,
  `rad`, `deg`, `kg`, `cd`, `K`, `°F` and the base units. Non-numeric
  meta suffixes (`utc`, `datetime`, `counter`, `factor`, `txt`, `nr`,
  `month`) explicitly emit no unit. In the WebUI the unit is shown
  with a small category emoji on the meter card.
- Dynamic meter-status label on the WebUI meter card (was always
  the static "Online"): `seen_15m > 0` → online (green), else
  `seen_60m > 0` → silent (amber), else offline (red).
  Uses `online_label` / `silent_label` / `offline_label` i18n keys.
- Restart button is back inside the pending-meters panel — earlier
  removal was reverted by user preference.

### Changed
- Carries every change from the 1.5.2 stable release: defensive
  `value_template` (`value_json.get(...) | default(none)`),
  `expire_after = 2 * avg_interval_s` (60 s rounded, 3600 s floor),
  `state_class: measurement` restricted to statistically meaningful
  `device_class` values, `device_class` for `m³` derived from
  the meter's reported `media`. See `wmbus_mqtt_bridge/CHANGELOG.md`
  for the full description.
- Carries every change from the 1.5.1 stable release: combined
  AI-development notice, ESPHome-pairing paragraph, mermaid radio
  list now lists CC1101/SX1276/SX1262, machine-translation
  disclaimers trimmed.

### CI
- Build workflow no longer rebuilds the image for text-only commits
  (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` inside the addon folder, repo-root
  docs). Path filter narrowed to `rootfs/**`, `Dockerfile`,
  `config.yaml`, `translations/**` and the workflow file itself.
- New `sync-rootfs` workflow keeps `wmbus_mqtt_bridge/rootfs`,
  `Dockerfile` and `translations` in lockstep with the dev addon
  by auto-committing back to `dev` after every push that changes
  the dev runtime. Manual escape hatch is
  `scripts/promote-rootfs.sh`.

### Notes
- Versions `1.5.1-dev` and `1.5.2-dev` were not separately published —
  the dev branch moved straight from `1.5.0-dev` to `1.5.3-dev` while
  promoting incremental fixes to the stable channel.

## 1.5.0-dev

Development snapshot tracking the upcoming `1.5.0` stable release.
First version of the embedded WebUI — please report regressions via
GitHub Issues.

### Added
- **WebUI with Home Assistant Ingress** — new panel "wMBus Bridge" served on
  port 8099 via `hassio_api: true` + `ingress: true`, no extra port exposure.
  Backed by a Python service (`rootfs/usr/bin/webui.py`) supervised by s6
  (`rootfs/etc/services.d/wmbus_webui/run`).
- **Multi-language UI** — translation layer in `rootfs/usr/bin/i18n.py`
  covering Polish, English, German, Czech and Slovak. All UI strings are
  machine-generated and may contain errors in any language.
- **Multi-language documentation** under `docs/` — full PL/EN/DE/CS/SK
  versions of the README, linked from the main README. All docs are
  machine-generated.
- Combined AI / machine-generated-text notice in the README (PL/EN).

### Changed
- Add-on stage set to `experimental`.
- Default `search_tolerance_m3` lowered from `1` to `0.05` for a more accurate
  match window during meter discovery.
- Bridge runtime script (`rootfs/usr/bin/bridge.sh`) heavily extended to back
  the WebUI flows (status, candidates, controls).
- Dockerfile: base image bumped to `alpine:3.23`; `python3` added to the
  add-on stage for the WebUI; `webui.py` made executable on build.

### Notes
- Version `1.5.0` bumped manually; previous published release was `1.4.7`.
